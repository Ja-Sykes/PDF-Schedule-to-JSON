# PDF-Schedule-to-JSON
Had the great idea to take my DQ work schedule which comes in the form of a PDF, parse it, find each worker, hours they work for the total week, find the dates worked and the times worked on said dates. Maybe even add an input that takes how much money they make per hour, and calculate (including tax deduction) what they can expect for the week.
